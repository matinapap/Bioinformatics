# Bioinformatics Project ‚Äì Sequence Alignment and HMM Profile Construction

## üìå Description

This project implements various bioinformatics algorithms including synthetic DNA sequence generation, pairwise and multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm, and the construction of a Profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM). It was developed as part of a university course assignment in Spring 2023-2024.

## üß¨ Project Structure

### 1. **Synthetic DNA Sequence Generation**

- Uses the `random` and `sys` libraries.
- Random DNA strings are created using the nucleotides A, C, G, and T.
- Patterns are randomly modified and inserted into the string using substitution or insertion.
- A total of 50 sequences are generated and split into two datasets:
  - `datasetA.txt` (15 sequences)
  - `datasetB.txt` (35 sequences)
  - Full dataset saved in `FullDataset.txt`

### 2. **Global Alignment**

- Implements a global alignment algorithm (`global_alignment(A, B, alpha=2)`) that uses dynamic programming.
- Scores:
  - +1 for match
  - -Œ±/2 for mismatch
  - Gap penalties included
- Returns aligned sequences and alignment score.

### 3. **Pairwise Distance Matrix**

- Calculates similarity scores between all sequence pairs in a dataset.
- Builds an n√ón matrix storing alignment scores for each sequence pair.
- Symmetric matrix.

### 4. **Neighbor Joining Algorithm**

- Constructs a phylogenetic tree based on the distance matrix.
- Iteratively merges the most similar clusters until all sequences are grouped.

### 5. **Progressive Alignment**

- Builds a multiple sequence alignment using a guide tree from the Neighbor-Joining algorithm.
- Aligns the most similar sequences first, then adds others progressively.
- Results saved in `multiple_alignment_result.txt`.

### 6. **Profile HMM Construction**

#### Conserved Region Detection

- Columns are categorized into:
  - `match`: ‚â•70% consensus
  - `delete`: ‚â•70% consensus with gaps
  - `insert`: other cases

#### Emission Probabilities

- For each conserved (match) column, calculates the probability distribution of nucleotides (A, C, G, T).
- Stores in an emission probability table.

#### Transition Probabilities

- Builds a transition matrix that describes the probabilities of moving between:
  - Match ‚Üí Match, Insert, Delete
  - Insert ‚Üí Match, Insert, Delete
  - Delete ‚Üí Match, Insert, Delete

### 7. **Viterbi Algorithm Preparation**

- Calculates emission probabilities for Match, Insert, and Delete states.
- These are used to determine the most probable path through the HMM for a given observed sequence.
